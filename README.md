## Version 0.1 — Scope and Limits

This repository is a **minimal, inspectable reference implementation** of the Conscious Protocol.

Version 0.1 demonstrates only:

- Explicit consent creation
- Consent revocation
- Audit logging of state changes
- A runnable example (`examples/demo.py`)

Non-goals for v0.1:

- Production readiness
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Networked or distributed operation
- Regulatory completeness

This version exists solely to make the core ideas **runnable, reviewable, and falsifiable**.

Minimal reference implementation of the **Conscious Protocol (CP)**.
This repository exists to make the core ideas of the Conscious Protocol
**inspectable, runnable, and auditable** in a concrete form.
It is intentionally minimal.
---
## Purpose
The Conscious Protocol defines a simple contract for how intelligent systems
should handle **explicit human consent** and **auditable state changes**.
This repository provides:
- a minimal consent object
- a minimal audit log
- a clear separation between protocol logic and application logic
Nothing here is production-optimized.  
Everything here is designed to be *readable and verifiable*.
