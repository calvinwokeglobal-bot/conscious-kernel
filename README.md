# conscious-kernel
Minimal reference implementation of the **Conscious Protocol (CP)**.
This repository exists to make the core ideas of the Conscious Protocol
**inspectable, runnable, and auditable** in a concrete form.
It is intentionally minimal.
---
## Purpose
The Conscious Protocol defines a simple contract for how intelligent systems
should handle **explicit human consent** and **auditable state changes**.
This repository provides:
- a minimal consent object
- a minimal audit log
- a clear separation between protocol logic and application logic
Nothing here is production-optimized.  
Everything here is designed to be *readable and verifiable*.
